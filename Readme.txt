Cambridge Preparation for the TOEFL(R) Test, Fourth Edition, CD-ROM

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING THE CD-ROM

* On Windows computers

Insert the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. The program will start automatically. If it does not start by itself, click on "My Computer" on your desktop or in the Start menu. Next, click on the CD-ROM icon ("Cambridge Prep").

A dialog box will give you two options:

1. Install the application on your hard drive
2. Run the application off the CD-ROM (limited functionality)

We recommend that you install the application on your hard drive. If you run the application off the CD-ROM, you will not be able to create or manage a user account, save your test results, or send your scores and responses to your teacher.

If you choose to install the application, select that option in the dialog box, click on "OK," and follow the instructions on the following screens to complete the installation process. A program folder and a desktop shortcut ("Cambridge TOEFL(R) Prep") will be created. Once the application has started, you can choose to create a user account or log in as a guest. If you choose to log in as a guest, you will not be able to save your test results or send your scores and responses to your teacher.

Whether you install the application on your hard drive or run the application off the CD-ROM, the CD-ROM needs to be in the CD-ROM drive for the application to work.

INTERNET ACCESS

To send your scores and responses electronically to your teacher and to access Cambridge Dictionaries Online, you will need an Internet connection. Due to security concerns, many computers and networks have firewalls and other devices that may restrict this application's Internet access. If you experience such issues, you may have to adjust your security settings, including adding the application name, "Cambridge TOEFL(R) Prep.exe" on Windows and "Cambridge TOEFL(R) Prep" on Macintosh computers, to your list of trusted applications.

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

If you have Windows 2000 Nvidia drivers, including Nvidia RIVA TNT2, Model 64 and Model 64PRO, note that certain features of version 5 and 6, which launch rundll32.exe and remain running in the background, have been shown to interfere with the performance of this CD-ROM. To resolve this compatibility issue, install the most recent versions of all of these drivers. You may also have to disable the Nvidia tray icon.
